# Integration seed

Set `SEED_PROFILE=integration` when running MigrationService against an integration-test database. The service migrates first, then inserts the fixtures below in one transaction. An absent, empty, or other profile only runs migrations. A seed error fails the process.

Rerunning the seed preserves existing fixture rows. Tests should create their own users, shopping lists, and purchases.
